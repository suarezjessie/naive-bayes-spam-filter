# Naive Bayes Classifier for Email Classification
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook that illustrates an email classification task which is to classify whether an email is a spam or ham. It also includes a written report since this is an assignment for a course named Intelligent Systems in my MS Computer Science degree.

For this Naive Bayes Classifier, only the basic and vanilla Naive Bayes Classifier was used an just one feature selection technique which is Mutual Information. The performance of the classifier with and without the feature selection technique is discussed in the report. In addition, there are also some relevant details discussed in the report such as vocabulary size and how to deal with words that are more frequently appearing than others.
